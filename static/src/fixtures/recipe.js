  directions: `
1.  Make pie crust.  Mix together with a fork the 1 cup flour, 2 teaspoons sugar and 1/2 cup softened butter.   Press into bottom and sides of a 9 inch pie pan.  (Put flour on hands if too sticky).
2.  Mix the pie sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
3.  Make the Crumb topping.  Mix the 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup flour and 1/3 cup softened butter with w fork in a medium bowl.
4.  Peel, core and slice the apples.  Layer apples with the pie sauce into  pie crust.  Dot top with 1 tablespoon butter.  Pour crumb topping onto top;  try to cover entire top.  Bake at 450 degree, preheated oven for 10 minutes, then turn down the oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake for an additional 40 minutes.`,
  notes: `
Martha gave me this recipe in 1994.

Always a hit.

I use Pillsbury All Ready pie crust instead of crust listed.
As an alternative, I mix the apple slices with the sugar and spices from the sauce and cook in a large pan with a lid for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Mix in the flour, then pour into crust.  Top with crumb topping and bake as directed.  This assures you don't get any crunchy apple pieces.`,
